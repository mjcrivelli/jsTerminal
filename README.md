A JavaScript Terminal

Basically it's a JavaScript terminal, i use this on my personal webpage to create a navigation. My first attempt was made only with JavaScript, but my results was very bad. Now i made this version using Angular.js, and the result is awesome.

To create the nav, i use two arrays, one with the commands, and other with the actions.
